              <h3>Audition day</h3>
              <p>
                All dancers need to be present the day of auditions. You should arrive promptly. Upon arrival, you need to sign in and take a sticker with a number on it. Make sure to pick up a preference sheet and warm up.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you cannot attend the audition due to schedule conflict (such as academic event or leadership retreat), then please e-mail a Director at dancer@andrew.cmu.edu in advance; make up auditions are available upon request prior to mainstage auditions. Should you not be able to attend either, then you will be placed on the unassigned dancers' d-list and may get into a dance in the future.
              </p>

              <h3>Process breakdown</h3>
              <ul> 
                <li>Directors will introduce themselves and discuss audition process</li>
                <li>Each choreographer will:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Introduce himself/herself</li> 
                    <li>Talk about piece and what they are looking for</li>
                    <li>Show a portion of their piece</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The Directors will teach a short audition piece (~32 counts), that will consist of a variety of dance styles</li>
                <li>Dancers will be given 30 minutes to practice and to hand in completed dance preference sheet</li>
                <li>Dancers will dance twice in groups of 8, all auditions will be recorded while all choreographers are watching</li>
                <li>When done auditioning, dancers are free to leave</li>
                <li>Once the auditions are over, choreographers will view the audition tapes once and request dancers</li>
                <li>Directors will then match dancers' rankings with the choreographers' requests</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Etiquette</strong></p>
              <p>
                No dancer should ever personally request to be placed in a dance by a choreographer and likewise they should never be asked by a choreographer to audition for a piece. If this occurs, please advise the directors.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Dancers' Placement</strong></p>
              <p>
                Dancers' preferences are matched meticulously with Choreographers' dancer lists. You will always be put into any dance that you are selected for, that you ranked, in the order that you ranked it.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Time Commitment</strong></p>
              <p>
                The beautiful aspect of DS is that the time commitment is up to you. If accepted into a dance, the dancer is required to dedicate a minimum of one hour per week per dance to learning choreography. A dancer can be in a max of 3 dances per semester (this may be subject to change if choreographing or participating in outside org.). You will also be required to participate in checkpoint, ticket sales, tech-rehearsals, dress-rehearsal and the show.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Time Commitment Tip</strong></p> 
              <p>
                Assume a 1 hour-per-dance time commitment. Be specific on your preference sheet the maximum number of dances that you would like to participate in. 
              </p>
              <p><strong>Audition Tips</strong></p>
              <p>
                Dress comfortably, preferably in dance or athletic clothes that you can move in. The (wood) floor may be slippery, and dancers may be expected to perform turns (pirouettes) or other moves, so wear appropriate shoes (jazz shoes, ballet slippers, soft-soled sneakers).
              </p>
              <p>
                Warm up and loosen your muscles. No particular level of ability, or any past dance experience at all, is required, but flexibility may help.
              </p>
              <p>
                SMILE! This is dancing. Dancing is supposed to be fun. Show that you're enjoying yourself!
