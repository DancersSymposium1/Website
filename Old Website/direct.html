                Directors are <strong>required</strong> to meet regularly with the DS advisor appointed to keep her informed and up-to-date about the organizations’ status and events. At these meetings, and all other non-standard* DS-related meetings, the following is required:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Every effort should be made for all directors to be present</li>
                <li>A minimum of 2 directors must attend</li>
                <li>All directors must discuss and agree upon the agenda before the meeting</li>
                <li>Minutes of the meeting must be emailed out afterwards for any directors who could not attend</li 
              </ul>
              <p>
                Standard meetings include AB Tech, cmuTV, UC Reservations, Athletic Dep’t for spacing, Music Dep’t for spacing, and Morewood for spacing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Directors are encouraged to choreograph and perform, and they are subject to the same rules as other Choreographers and Dancers. Directors may not influence the selection of Dancers for any piece except for those they choreograph themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                Directors may serve in this capacity until they graduate or wish to pass their responsibilities to a new Director. If a situation presents itself where the Directors disagree on a matter, they should seek advice from the organization advisor.
              </p>
              <p>
                Being a Director is a very important responsibility; if a Director does not live up to his or her commitment, or displays behavior that could damage the Dancers’ Symposium name, the other Directors should seek guidance from the advisor. A Director removal occurs when all other Directors and the advisor all agree that the removal of this Director will benefit the organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                Any situations involving conflict of interest, special circumstances or that is not covered by the current Constitution will be carefully and thoroughly examined by the Directors. The Directing Staff has the final decision-making authority in any matter within the organization. All decisions will be notified to the individuals involved. Any decisions involving uncommon consequences will be notified to the advisor. Any situations involving financial or legal consequences will be discussed with the advisor prior to making decisions.

              <h3>Director Selection</h3>
              <p>
                New Directors are chosen to replace those who are graduating and/or relinquishing their responsibilities. DS members will make nominations at the end of each semester, as needed, for individual performers to join the directing team. Nominees may be chosen from among Dancers who have performed with DS for 2 semesters, and nominations must be accompanied by a brief explanation of why they would make a good Director. Directors may seek opinions from those Choreographers who have had the nominee in their dance, or from the nominee’s fellow Dancers. The Directors must unanimously approve a nominee before s/he may join the directing team the following semester. 
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Privileges:</strong> each Director is given 1 T-shirt and DVD, a Director gift (an article of cloth), and is invited to the Directors’ dinner. They are also given the option of reserving 4 seats at the show. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The inability of Dancers, Choreographers, or Directors to the follow rules & guidelines stated above could result in any of the following consequences: 
              </p>

                <li>being cut from a dance</li>
