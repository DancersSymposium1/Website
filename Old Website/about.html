              <h3>History of Dancers' Symposium</h3>
              <p>
                Dancers' Symposium (DS) was founded in 1995 by a group of faculty and students to provide an opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students to choreograph and perform original dance pieces for their peers, faculty, and family. It offers instruction in various dance styles from around the world and is an excellent showcase for the diverse talents of the Carnegie Mellon community. Dancers' Symposium is recognized and funded by the Student Senate.

                <dt>What dancers should expect from choreographers:</dt>
                <dd>A weekly rehearsal at a set time and location. Dancers should be informed of any change in this schedule prior to their rehearsal. Choreographers should be prepared every week and keep teaching on a schedule such that dancers know 2/3 of the piece by the checkpoint date. Choreographers should inform dancers of any special policies and be patient with the abilities of their dancers.</dd>
